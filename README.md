# Mainframe

Mainframe was created to modernize aviation maintenace project tracking. It aims to do away with the old book-and-pen passdown and the microsoft word passdown.
It eliminates data loss and cuts down time spent flipping pages. Mainframe can easily be adapted to any organizations' style of collaboration.

Mainframe allows teams to:
- quickly and easily get up to date with current projects
- add further progress to existing projects
- retrieve and review every step taken on previous projects
- analyze and identify recurring issues with individual aircraft
